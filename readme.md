## FAQ

#### How is this different than [npm repo](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/repo)?

npm repo is an npm built-in. Here are the differences:

* `opts` allows you to open issues page(s)
* `openg` supports multiple module openings, `npm repo` supports only one at a time.

<br>

## Contribute

```js
npm run install
```

Since this is a [lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lern://github.com/lerna/lerna) project, both `openg-cli` and `openg` are contained within the `packages/` folder.
